# **INTRODUCTION REPOSITORY**

**Greetings! My name is Kadyn, screen name Gigoiy.**

## About My Skills

- I'm a polyglot! I'm very experienced in Python, the C-Suite, Powershell, and Rust. With that, I can pick up other languages very easily by referencing the documentation.
- I'm very good at writing documentation! I obviously know how to write in MarkDown, and I'm also fairly experienced in LaTeX.
- There's way more but I'll save that for the "Flexing" section.

## Flexing

- I took a pause on school because I realized how OP my autism super powers are.
- I learned the basics of Fourier Analysis by myself (And could learn more if I wanted to).
- My classmates and my professors realized I was light-years ahead of my peers due to the insane amounts of experience from work.
- My favorite thing to do is to learn new things and I'm constantly learning new things pertaining to the field in my home lab, which is also why the statement above is true.
- I had other classmates gather around me during a hands-on activity in one of my coding classes, wanting to learn from me and asking me questions on why I'm doing some things that I'm doing.
- I built an Arduino car robot by myself without ANY help from my lab partner because she didn't put in any effort in the class or learning the material. Due to my already-cemented experience in Arduino prototyping, she pretty much used me.
- I accomplished integrating the eBay Browsing RESTful API into a final project for the same coding class mentioned two lines above, in a single day without any prior knowledge in the subject. Not to mention that this was way beyond the scope of the class.

## Current Project

- My best friend and I want to develop an app!
- This app is going to be the hub for all collectors!
- This app is going to allow you to track the items in your collection, tell you the value of your collection, and much more!
- We plan to implement a verified trading, buying, and selling function!
