# **INTRODUCTION REPOSITORY**

**Greetings! My name is Kadyn, screen name Gigoiy.**

## About My Skills

- I'm a polyglot! I'm very experienced in Python, the C-Suite, Powershell, and Rust. With that, I can pick up other languages very easily by referencing the documentation.
- I'm very good at writing documentation! I obviously know how to write in MarkDown, and I'm also fairly experienced in LaTeX.
- There's way more but I'll save 

## Current Project

- My best friend and I want to develop an app!
- This app is going to be the hub for all collectors!
- This app is going to allow you to track the items in your collection, tell you the value of your collection, and much more!
- We plan to implement a verified trading, buying, and selling function!
